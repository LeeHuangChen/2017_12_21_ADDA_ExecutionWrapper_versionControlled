Welcome to ADDA.

ADDA is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.

Here are some brief notes on how to run ADDA:

USAGE:
If you run adda with the option -h you get the command line options:
>adda -h
adda Version $Id$ for  at ...
Usage: adda[OPTIONS] nid

-v #            loglevel [1]
-V              print version and exit.
-h              print help and exit.
-K #            parameter k (smoothness of sigmoid) [100]
-C #            parameter c (turning point of sigmoid) [10]
-E #            decay parameter e [0.05]
-M #            maximum of sigmoid [1]
-N #            minimum of sigmoid [0]
-n #            file of sorted neighbours [neighbours.in]
-f #            file of indices for neighbours [index.in]
-q #            file of list of nids [nids.in]
-t #            file of trees [trees]
-d              algorithm modifier: descend.
-s              disallow shortening of domains.
-i #            maximum iterations [10]
-r #            resolution [10]

I typically use a command-line like:

>adda -K 73.70676 -C 8.33957 -E 0.05273 -M 1.417000 -N 0.008000 -i 100 -n links -f links.index -t domain_trees -v 1 -q list -d 1

## input files ##
You need four input files. Values in these files should be tab-separated.

1. links:
List of pairwise links between proteins. Proteins here are identified by numbers (nid) and the format
of this file is:

nid1	nid2    ignored	from1   to1     na	from2   to2	na	na	na
2	17992	na	6       346     na	2       343     na	na	na

for the pairwise alignment between sequence 2 and sequence 17992 stretching from residue
6 to 346 on sequence 2 and from 2 to 343 on sequence 17992.

This file has to be sorted by nid1.

2. links.index:
An index of the links file. This file can be generated by running the command
adda_index links > links.index

3. domain_trees:
Putative domain partitions. The format is:
nid	node	parent	depth	from    to
2       0       0       0       0       52
2       1       0       1       0       35
2       2       1       2       0       23
2       3       2       3       0       8
2       4       2       3       8       23
2       5       1       2       23      35
2       6       0       1       35      52
2       7       6       2       35      43
2       8       7       3       35      39
2       9       7       3       39      43
2       10      6       2       43      52

for the tree of putative domains of sequence 2. This file has to be sorted
by nid and node! Note, that here the ranges have been scaled down by a factor
of 10, as has been described in the publication.

4. list
List of proteins (i.e., their numerical identifiers) that you would like to
run adda on. This list specifies a subgraph of links that ADDA uses.
